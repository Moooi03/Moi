## Name
This code is for a program that I called "guess the animal", I know it has a very simple name, but what really matters is the code.

## How it works?

It is easy, this program it is a game that will try to guess in the animal that you actually are thinking, it will start always in the same way
it will say that if the animal taht you are thinking about is a horse, that is the base, after you say that you are thinking in another animal
it would ask you in wich one, after that the program would ask you to mention a question, with only yes/no answer, to to identify 
what differentiates one animal from the other.

### How it works 2.0

Si Resp = SI
         		    +-----------+
         P-->  | Pregunta  +
               +-----------+
              NO |       | SI
                 |       |
    		+-----------+ +--------------+
   		| Animal 1  + | Nuevo Animal +
      +-----------+ +--------------+
         b) Si Resp = NO
         	    	+-----------+
         P-->  | Pregunta  +
               +-----------+
              SI |       | NO
                 |       |
    	+-----------+ +--------------+
   		| Animal 1  + | Nuevo Animal +
     +-----------+ +--------------+

#### you had to continue playin as long as you can

 The longer you play, the program would have more information about different animals, of course all depends on the player to put the questions correctly,
 because the program is just learning from the player, so if you continue playing it would be a moment where the program would guess correctly the animal
 that you are thinkign about with only your answers to the question it gives to you.

The data will be recovered in an archive named "data.pan", this archive in my github is in blank, but while you play it will be 
completing by itself.
